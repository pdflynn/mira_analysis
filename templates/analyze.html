    <h1>Analyze</h1>
    <p>This is the analysis page, where inspection work will actually be done.</p>
    <p>Essentially, during an inspection procedure, you'll get an image of some section of the plane on this page.</p>
    <p>Each image, which has been stitched together and run through a computer vision algoirthm, will have visual indicators of possible structural damage.</p>
    <p>The user of this application will be able to "APPROVE" or "DENY" each section of the plane.</p>
    <p>If a plane segment is denied, a reason will be provided, and further inspection can occur, or the plane can be grounded for repairs.</p>
